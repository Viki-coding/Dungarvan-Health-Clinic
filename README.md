## Dungarvan Health Clinic
## Introduction 
The Dungarvan Health Clinic website highlights the holistic offerings of health services in one accessible health centre. 
We aim to showcase the services provided, the qualifications of its health practitioners and allow the user to contact or make an appointment easily with a couple of options.
### Description  - Project Purpose 
The wesbite consists of 3 pages.  Each clear, simple and effective. The user logs on to the website, sees a friendly faced image, to make a possible apprehensive patient more relaxed.  The user (who may be feeling unwell) do not need to see a complicated website to navigate through, our aim was to make the website easily naviagaable and intuative with clear call to actions. 

### User Demographics - Target audience
The target audience is new and existing patients based in the Dungarvan area within a 20 mile radius.  It also aims to increase its patients from the county of Waterford needing specialist advice in areas such as 'Asthma management' and 'Women's Health'. With the increase population of Ukrainian refugees we wanted to highlight the distinct advantage of having a Ukrainian doctor who would be able to communicate easily with our increasing Ukrainian population.  We have included these keywords in our opening header so SEO search results will be optimized. 

## UX
##Site Goals
First Time users will find the site intuative and easy to navigate.  The site is clear, the Home page has a clear call to actions with features such as a link using the phone number to book an appointment, highlghting the phone number visably and displaying the clinics location easily. 
Our return visitors will know that the clinics phone number is accessible on the Home page and will be familliar with the call back form.

##Design Choices
### Color Scheme
We choose these color schemes as green is a calming color and purple is a healing color.  The colors work well together and provoke a profesional yet warm tone which will be communicated to the user.  <p>We checked which font color stood out best against these, both getting 5 star ratings.  Graphic illustrated below. <p>

### Typograpghy
We used the font Monsterrat which use a Sans Serif font which is good for accessibility and a dyslexix friendly font. 
Looks professional.

### Imagery 
We have professional head shots taken of each of our healhcare workers with the medical backgrounds with similar style and size. All the images show a professional healthcare worker and our opening HOME page image shows a friendly smiling face to make the user more at ease and will encourage them to contact us. 
All images contain 'alt' text so that it can be more accessible for screen readers and search engines.

### Wireframes
We created a wireframe using Balsamiq to plan out the stucture and style of website and spoke with the users to gain their insigt and views.  This was created for  displaying the site on mobiles and larger screens such as tablets and desktops. This was the beginning of our design journey as we progresed with the design we made some changes to the actual website. During this planning phase we researched the fonts and backgound colors and text colors that would be most suitable and gained user feedback.

## Features

####HOME PAGE
The HOME page contains a clear information secion on what we offer. 
Our navigation bar on the top, which shows a menu 'burger' icon on mobile and expands to detail on larger devices. Our navigation menu clearly shows which page the user is on as it is underlined. 
The hero image shown here is of a friendly, happy faced healthcare worker which sets up the friendly tone and familiarity that Dungarvan Health Clinic wish to portray. 
We clearly list the healthcare services provided. 
Our call to action feature on this Home page is the phone number, we want people to contact us.  The phone number is visiable, on larger screens it enlarges when the mouse hovers over it and if clicked will begin a call.

####CALL BACK REQUEST
The user has the benefit of requesting a 'Call Back' with regard to a specific health category.  This is done through an easy to use form. This form once sumbitted will be sent to the administative team at the Health Clinic.  The admin team will then call back the patients and offer them the appropaite appointment. 
The benefit of the 'Call-Back' form is useful for 3 main reasons - 
1. It allows patients who may be at work, or out of hours, or busy with childcare an opportunity to take action to making the first-step in contacting a health professional.
2. It allows for the Health practice itself to manage the appointments in a more efficient manner as it sees the category the patient is interested in and allows them to 'Call Back' in quieter clinic times.
3. It allows the healthclinic to gain insighful data of requests and can make future plans such as expanding specific healthcare areas to accomadate increasing needs. 
This form asks for the usersd first and last name, email and phone number.  It then asks to choose which health care area they wish to get a call back about, they select using a radio button whether its the GP, Dietican, Asmatha Specialist or Women's Health appointment they are seeking. This feature allows the user to interact with the clinic, even during out of hours and creates an action that they will receive a call back if the form is submitted. When they hover the mouse over the SUBMIT button the text enlarges encouraging them to click and commit. 
Navigation and footer bar remains the same.

### Navigation & Interaction Points 
We have 3 pages on our site - Home - Meet the Team - Call Back Request
This will be displayed on our nav bar at the top of each page and can be navigatged between easily.
We will be interacting with the user when they click on the Phone link on the HOME page, they will have their first interactions with their healthcare worker when they view them on the 'Meet the Team' page  where they can get familiar with which healthcare worker would be the best fit for them.   Another great interaction point is our forms section to make a Call Back request - creating an action to making that first step to iniating an appointment.

  We also opened the site on physically different devices - mobile phone, samsung table, applemac laptop. 
We created a specific testing template to ensure and re-check all pages were working correctly as speficfied.
