### DUNGARVAN HEALTH CLINIC

___

### Introduction
The Dungarvan Health Clinic website highlights the holistic offerings of health services in one accessible health centre. The main goal of the website is for users to contact us.
We aim to showcase the services provided, the qualifications of its health practitioners and allow the user to contact or make an appointment easily with a couple of options.

### Description  - Project Purpose 
The website consists of 3 pages.  Each clear, simple and effective. The user logs on to the website, sees a friendly faced image, making a possible apprehensive patient more relaxed.  The user (who may be feeling unwell) does not need to see a complicated website to navigate through, our aim was to make the website easily navigable and intuitive with clear call to actions, i.e. to contact the clinic. 

### User Demographics - Target audience
The target audience is new and existing patients based in the Dungarvan area within a 20 mile radius.  It also aims to increase its patients from the county of Waterford needing specialist advice in areas such as 'Asthma management' and 'Women's Health'. With the increase population of Ukrainian refugees we wanted to highlight the distinct advantage of having a Ukrainian doctor who would be able to communicate easily with our Ukrainian population.  We have included these keywords in our opening header so SEO search results will be optimized. 

### UX
**Site Goals**: 
First Time users will find the site intuitive and easy to navigate.  The site provides the user with what they expect:
* How to contact us
* Where to find us
* Who we are
* Call Back

The Home page has a clear call to action with features such as a phone number link to book an appointment, highlighting the phone number visibly and displaying the clinics location easily. 
Our return visitors will know that the clinics phone number is accessible on the Home page and will be familiar with the call back form.

## Design Choices ##

### Color Scheme
We choose these color schemes as green is a calming color and purple is a healing color.  The colors work well together and provoke a professional yet warm tone which will produce a positive emotional response with the user.  <p>We checked which font color stood out best against these, both getting 5 star ratings.  Graphic illustrated below. <p>

### Typography
We used the font Montserrat which use a Sans Serif which is good for accessibility and is a dyslexia friendly font. 
We feel it looks professional and is clear and easy to read. 

### Imagery 
We have professional head shots taken of each of our healthcare workers within the medical workspace using similar backgrounds, style and size. All the images show a professional healthcare worker. The HOME page image shows a friendly smiling face, creating an emotional response to make the user more at ease, encouraging them to contact us. 
All images contain 'alt' text so that it can be more accessible for screen readers and search engines.

### Wireframes
We created a wireframe using Balsamiq to plan out the structure and style of the website. We spoke with the users to gain their insight and views.  This was created for  displaying the site on mobiles and larger screens such as tablets and desktops. This was the beginning of our design journey, as we progressed with the design we made some changes to the actual website. During this planning phase we researched the fonts and background colors and text colors that would be most suitable and gained user feedback.

> ## CALL BACK REQUEST
> 
The user has the benefit of requesting a 'Call Back' with regard to a specific health category.  This is done through an easy to use form. This form once submitted will be sent to the administrative team at the Health Clinic.  The admin team will then call back the patients and offer them the appropriate appointment. 

**Picture below of example of Call Back Request Form**

<img width="900" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 17 34 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b930ba0-c06a-479e-8778-0229d0308514">

**The benefit of the 'Call-Back' form is useful for 3 main reasons**:
1. It allows patients who may be at work, or out of hours, or busy with childcare an opportunity to take action to making the first-step in contacting a health professional.
2. It allows for the Health practice itself to manage the appointments in a more efficient manner as it sees the category the patient is interested in and allows them to 'Call Back' in quieter clinic times.
3. It allows the health clinic to gain insightful data of requests and can make future plans such as expanding specific healthcare areas to accommodate increasing needs. 

This form asks for the users first and last name, email and phone number.  It then asks to choose which health care area they wish to get a call back about, they select using a radio button whether itâ€™s the GP, Dietician, Asthma Specialist or Women's Health appointment they are seeking. 

This feature allows the user to interact with the clinic, even during out of hours and creates an action - they will receive a call back if the form is submitted. When they hover the mouse over the SUBMIT button the text enlarges encouraging them to click and commit. 

Navigation and footer bar remains the same on all three pages to offer consistency and good user experience.

### Navigation & Interaction Points 
We have 3 pages on our site - Home - Meet the Team - Call Back Request

Our three pages will be displayed on our nav bar at the top of each page and can be navigated easily between.  The user will understand which page they are on as there is an underline under the active page.

We will be interacting with the user when they click on the Phone link on the HOME page.  

They will have their first interaction with their healthcare worker when they view them on the 'Meet the Team' page. They can get familiar with which healthcare worker would be the best fit for them.   

Another great interaction point is our forms section to make a Call Back request - creating an action to making that first step to initiating an appointment. 

Finally they can interact with our social media sites by clicking on the links which will open in a new page. 



## Future Implementation Section 
This site could be developed in the future with the patients making their own on-line bookings. 
Payments could be made on-line with a history of invoices paid so the user can claim it back on their tax relief rather than having physical pieces of paper stored in random places at home. 
Patients could access Downloadable patient information sheets. 
List of available services and doctors could be expanded. 

## Accessibility
Meaningful Alt descriptions on all images making it suitable for screen readers and descriptive for screen reader users. Aria labels used to describe the content for screen readers and other accessibility tools.
Colors suitable for people who are color blind and sans serif text suitable for people with dyslexia.

### Quality Assurance 
We took a systematic and structural approach to manually test each page to ensure it functions correctly and to help identify potential bugs.
We created a specific testing template to ensure and re-check all pages were working correctly as specified with expected and actual outcomes using a methodical approach.   

**Test Evaluation Sheet**:

<img width="1195" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-29 at 15 12 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1cebea5-8a38-42fa-b9d0-993790b15741">

As shown in the evaluation sheet above we navigated around our site and tested all available options to ensure they were working as intended, such as checking if a valid email address is entered and prompting the user if it is not, checking when we click on the Facebook icon, that it does in fact take us to a Facebook page and opens in a new page. 

  ### BUGS
  **Known bugs**
  On our Call back page we would like to click on the SUBMIT button and be redirected to a page to say Thank you for your request, we will be in touch shortly.  But we were unable to do this. 

  **Solved Bugs**
  When running W3C CSS validator - it displayed the following message: 
  
    <img width="1291" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-27 at 12 18 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87aed563-5abe-4383-a099-9e2f15e15b68">

 We fixed the spaces in the file name and in the root directory which fixed the errors.

Our navigation bar was overlapping with our main header, we watched some youtube videos to understand how to recify this and found "Prevent Fixed Navbar overlapping" by ByteGrad very helpful. 

On the phone link on the Home page we created code to make the phone number larger on hover, it was working and then on testing was not working.  We fixed this bug as we had subsequntly put the phone number in heading 3 style, so then change the parent in the hover code.

### User Experience Assurance
We want to ensure the end-user has a smooth experience and addresed any potential issues by testing and fixing any bugs on the site.  Testing was on-going throughout the build.   We used Chrome development tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we progressed. 
Each page has been inspected using google chrome developer tools and Firefox inspector tool to ensure each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. We tested the site on the following devices: apple iPhone 12 mini mobile phone, a  Samsung  Galaxy tablet and MacBook Pro for testing the site on various real time screen sizes. All tests responded and well with no bugs reported.
